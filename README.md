# JUnit Test

The aim of this project is to perform a unit test for a Java Program. The program analyses a source file to check for mismatch of delimiters. Unit test tests the method called getNextChar(). The method reads every character of the source file and skips line comments, block comments, string literals, and character literals. 

Java project is built with Maven.
